### What is it?
A general framework/codebase for running machine learning experiments. Primarilly evolution based reinforcement learning, but could be used for anything.

Each different branch will be for different experiment sets, some may follow a general template (as in master), others could be completely different. A general template will be followed where possible for efficient reuse.

### General Features:
- A python script for running an experiment.
- A python requirements file to automatically install dependencies.
- A bash script for running experiment batches.
